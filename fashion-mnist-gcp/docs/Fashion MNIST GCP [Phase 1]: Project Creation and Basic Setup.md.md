# Fashion MNIST GCP [Phase 1]: Project Creation and Basic Setup

## Phase 1: Project Creation and Basic Setup

### Overview
Phase 1 establishes the foundational infrastructure and project structure needed for the Fashion MNIST GCP implementation. This phase focuses on essential setup tasks without premature complexity.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. GCP Project Creation and Billing Setup
- Created GCP project: `fashion-mnist-gcp`
- Enabled billing with active payment method
- Project ID confirmed and available for resource provisioning
- Verified access to GCP Console with Owner role

#### 2. Cost Monitoring Configuration
- Set up budget alerts at two thresholds:
  - First alert: $100
  - Second alert: $200
- Configured email notifications for budget threshold breaches
- Alerts will monitor actual costs and forecasted spend

#### 3. GitHub Repository Structure
- Created project directory: `sanskarGupta551/Fashion_MNIST/fashion-mnist-gcp/`
- Established folder structure:
  - `/docs` - Documentation files including README.md
  - `/notebook` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and development
  - `/src` - Source code for all components
  - `/diagram` - Architecture diagrams and visualizations
- Added `fashion-mnist-architecture.svg` to diagram folder

#### 4. Initial Documentation
- Created README.md in docs folder
- Established documentation structure for future phases
- Set up basic project overview and implementation approach

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Deferred Service Account Setup**: Service accounts will be created on-demand in later phases when specific GCP services are implemented

2. **Simplified Initial Structure**: Focused on essential setup to enable immediate development work

3. **Cost Controls**: Early budget alerts ensure cost awareness from project inception

4. **Directory Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated folders for different asset types
