# Fashion MNIST: Webapp Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Fashion MNIST Webapp is a comprehensive portfolio demonstration platform that showcases Machine Learning engineering capabilities through multiple implementation approaches. The webapp serves as the central interface for exploring three distinct implementation paradigms: Localized Development, GCP-Native, and Cloud Agnostic solutions.

## Architecture

### Technical Stack

#### Frontend Framework
- Next.js 14 with App Router architecture
- TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development experience
- React 19 for component-based UI development

#### UI Components & Styling
- shadcn/ui component library for pre-built, accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
- Zinc color scheme for professional, tech-focused appearance

#### Data Visualization
- Recharts for interactive charts and graphs
- Built-in chart components from shadcn/ui

#### State Management & API Communication
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- Axios for HTTP requests to backend services

### Development Environment

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version) managed through nvm
- WSL2 environment for Windows users
- VS Code with Remote-WSL extension

#### Package Management
- npm with --legacy-peer-deps flag for dependency resolution
- Separate dependency management for React 19 compatibility

### Component Architecture

#### Key Component Categories
1. **Dashboard Components**: Main interface elements for project overview
2. **Model Components**: Visualization of different ML model implementations
3. **Visualization Components**: Charts, graphs, and performance metrics
4. **Shared UI Components**: Reusable elements from shadcn/ui

## Features

### Interactive Dashboard
- Side-by-side comparison of three implementation approaches
- Real-time performance metrics visualization
- Interactive model selection and parameter adjustment

### Implementation Showcases
1. **Localized Development**
   - Demonstration of traditional ML workflow
   - Local resource utilization metrics
   - File system and memory usage visualization

2. **GCP-Native Implementation**
   - Vertex AI integration showcase
   - GCP service utilization dashboard
   - Cost and performance analytics

3. **Cloud Agnostic Approach**
   - Multi-cloud compatibility demonstration
   - Portable architecture visualization
   - Cross-platform deployment metrics

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time inference latency tracking
- Resource utilization graphs
- Cost comparison across implementations

### User Experience Features
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Dark/light mode support
- Accessibility compliance
- Progressive loading for optimal performance

## API Integration

### Backend Endpoints
The webapp integrates with multiple backend services:
- Model inference APIs for all three approaches
- Metrics collection endpoints
- Cost calculation services
- Real-time monitoring streams

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger API requests
2. Backend services process requests based on selected implementation
3. Results are displayed through interactive visualizations
4. Performance metrics are updated in real-time

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Optional authentication for administrative features
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration for API access control

### Data Protection
- No storage of sensitive user data
- Secure API communication
- Environment variable management for credentials

## Deployment

### Hosting
- Google Cloud Run for serverless deployment
- Automatic scaling based on traffic
- CDN integration for static assets

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated builds through GitHub Actions
- Environment-specific deployments
- Automated testing before deployment

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Image optimization through Next.js Image component
- Static site generation where applicable
- Client-side caching strategies

### API Optimization
- Request batching where appropriate
- Efficient data fetching patterns
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Application Monitoring
- Error tracking and logging
- Performance metrics collection
- User interaction analytics

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Cloud Run metrics
- API endpoint performance
- Resource utilization tracking

## Maintenance and Updates

### Version Control
