# Fashion MNIST GCP [Phase 2]: Data Engineering & Preparation (Part 3)

## Phase 2: Data Engineering & Preparation

### Overview
Part 3 of Phase 2 focuses on validating the data processing strategy for the Fashion MNIST dataset. This phase tested the normalization and augmentation approaches that will be implemented in the GCP environment, ensuring that our preprocessing pipeline is effective before moving to model development.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Data Preprocessing Strategy Validation
- Tested and validated preprocessing approach:
  - Normalization: Applied Min-Max [0,1] normalization to all data splits
  - Split strategy: Preserved original train/test split (60,000/10,000) with additional validation split from training data (20%)
  - Augmentation: Implemented on-the-fly augmentation for training data only
- Validated preprocessing stages with visual inspection
- Confirmed effectiveness of strategy in local notebook environment

#### 2. Data Augmentation Implementation
- Implemented enhanced augmentation strategy with multiple transformations:
  - Rotation: Random rotations in range ±15°
  - Brightness: Adjustments between 0.8-1.2× original
  - Contrast: Modifications with factors between 0.7-1.3
  - Horizontal flips: Applied with 50% probability
  - Shifts: Random pixel shifts within image boundaries
  - Zoom: Scaling between 0.9-1.1× original size
- Established random application of transformations to maximize diversity
- Verified augmentation effectiveness through visual inspection across multiple classes (T-shirt/top, Trouser, Dress, Bag)

#### 3. Processing Pipeline Design
- Created data generator approach for efficient training:
  - On-the-fly augmentation during batch generation
  - Memory-efficient processing of training data
  - Consistent normalization across all data splits
- Designed processing pattern for training/validation/test splits
- Confirmed data integrity through visual inspection
- Determined optimal batch generation approach for training

### Key Findings

1. **Preprocessing Strategy Validation**:
   - Normalization in [0,1] range confirmed as optimal for neural network training
   - Data augmentation visibly increases diversity of training examples
   - 80/20 train/validation split provides sufficient validation data while maintaining robust training set

2. **Augmentation Effectiveness**:
   - Multiple augmentation techniques successfully create diverse variations
   - Augmentation parameters (rotation range, brightness factors, etc.) preserve core class characteristics
   - Horizontal flips appropriate for most Fashion MNIST classes
   - Transformations create meaningful variation without distorting essential features

3. **Neural Network Feature Learning**:
   - Determined that manual feature engineering (HOG, statistical moments) unlikely to provide significant benefits
   - Modern CNN architectures can effectively learn optimal features directly from normalized pixel data
   - Simple normalization provides sufficient preprocessing for neural network training
   - Focus should remain on effective data augmentation rather than complex feature engineering

### Implementation Details

#### Data Processing Framework

The validated data processing strategy includes:

- **Normalization Process**: Consistent normalization to [0,1] range applied to all data splits (training, validation, and test)

- **Augmentation Strategy**: Comprehensive set of image transformations applied only to training data, including:
  - Random rotations with configurable angle range
  - Brightness and contrast adjustments
  - Horizontal flips
  - Random pixel shifts
  - Zoom effects for scale variation

- **Batch Generation**: Implemented efficient mini-batch generation with:
  - On-the-fly augmentation
  - Randomized batch composition
  - Memory-efficient processing

#### Training Integration Approach

The strategy for integrating preprocessing with model training includes:

- Consistent normalization applied to all data splits before training begins
- Augmentation applied only during training and only to training data
- Validation and testing performed on normalized but non-augmented data
- Batch-based processing to enable training on large datasets
- New augmented variations generated for each epoch to maximize diversity
