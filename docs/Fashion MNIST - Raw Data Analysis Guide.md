# Fashion MNIST: Raw Data Analysis

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive data analysis approach for the raw Fashion MNIST dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding dataset characteristics, identifying patterns, and gathering insights for optimal model development.

## 1. Dataset Overview
- Examine the 10 clothing categories (T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot)
- Analyze dataset structure: 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- Verify image specifications: 28x28 pixels, grayscale format
- Calculate class distribution for training and test sets
- Identify any class imbalances

## 2. Statistical Analysis
- Analyze pixel intensity distribution (0-255 range)
- Calculate global mean and standard deviation
- Compute class-specific statistics
- Measure brightness and contrast variations
- Generate statistical summary tables

## 3. Visual Pattern Analysis
- Perform edge detection analysis
- Identify shape characteristics per category
- Analyze pattern complexity
- Compare visual similarities between classes
- Document distinguishing features

## 4. Dimensionality Analysis
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Calculate explained variance ratios
- Create t-SNE visualizations
- Analyze feature importance maps
- Identify critical image regions

## 5. Class Relationship Analysis
- Calculate inter-class similarity scores
- Identify confusable class pairs
- Measure intra-class variability
- Find challenging samples
- Create similarity matrices

## 6. Data Quality Assessment
- Detect statistical outliers
- Identify potential anomalies
- Verify data consistency
- Check for mislabeled samples
- Validate data integrity

## 7. Preprocessing Insights
- Compare normalization techniques
- Analyze preprocessing impacts
- Evaluate augmentation potential
- Determine optimal strategies
- Document preprocessing recommendations

## 8. Performance Predictions
- Rank categories by classification difficulty
- Predict common error patterns
- Estimate expected accuracy ranges
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Set realistic targets

## 9. Comparative Analysis
- Compare with original MNIST dataset
- Analyze complexity differences
- Evaluate classification challenges
- Document key distinctions
- Provide architecture recommendations

## Data Recording Strategy
- Save analysis results after each major step
- Use consistent naming: `{analysis_type}.{format}`
- Store in Cloud Storage bucket: `fashion-mnist-dev/analysis-results`
- Write key metrics to BigQuery dataset: `fashion_mnist_raw_analysis`
- Format: CSV for tables, JSON for nested data, PNG/SVG for visualizations

## Deliverables
1. Statistical analysis report
2. Visualization collection
3. Pattern analysis findings
4. Quality assessment results
5. Preprocessing recommendations
6. Performance predictions
7. Executive summary

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of dataset characteristics
- Identification of all major patterns and relationships
- Clear preprocessing and engineering recommendations
- Accurate performance predictions
- Comprehensive documentation for stakeholders
