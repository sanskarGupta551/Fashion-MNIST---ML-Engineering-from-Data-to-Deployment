# Fashion MNIST: GCP-native Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines a professional ML Engineering implementation for the Fashion MNIST classification system using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. While Fashion MNIST is a well-understood dataset, this project deliberately focuses on demonstrating enterprise-grade ML engineering practices and comprehensive MLOps capabilities.

The implementation showcases proficiency across the complete ML lifecycle, emphasizing:
- Production-ready architecture that scales beyond Fashion MNIST
- MLOps best practices including feature management and model governance
- Cost-effective utilization of GCP managed services
- End-to-end ownership from data engineering to production monitoring

This GCP-native approach serves as part of a larger portfolio project demonstrating three implementation paradigms (Localized, GCP-Native, and Cloud Agnostic), highlighting technical versatility and professional ML engineering expertise.
