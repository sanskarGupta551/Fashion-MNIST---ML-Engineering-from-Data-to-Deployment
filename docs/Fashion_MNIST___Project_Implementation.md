## Project Timeline

The project follows an iterative approach where each phase builds upon the previous ones. As learning progresses, specific details and implementations will be documented within each phase.

- **Phase 1-2**: 1-2 weeks (Foundation)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 weeks (Model Development)
- **Phase 5-7**: 2-3 weeks (Deployment & MLOps)
- **Phase 8-9**: 1-2 weeks (Presentation & Validation)

## Key Principles

1. **Learning-Driven**: Each phase allows for exploration and documentation of new concepts
2. **Flexible Implementation**: Objectives and best practices guide but don't constrain
3. **Three-Way Approach**: Consistent demonstration across Localized, GCP-Native, and Cloud Agnostic implementations
4. **Progressive Documentation**: Details are added as implementation progresses
5. **Professional Standards**: Focus on enterprise-grade practices throughout

## Success Criteria

- Demonstrated proficiency across all three implementation approaches
- Complete documentation of learning journey
- Working web application showcasing all implementations
- Comprehensive understanding of ML lifecycle phases
- Portfolio-ready presentation materials

This implementation structure provides a clear framework while maintaining the flexibility needed for effective learning and demonstration of ML engineering capabilities.
