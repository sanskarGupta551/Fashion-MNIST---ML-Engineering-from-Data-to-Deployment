# Fashion MNIST GCP [Phase 2]: (1/3) Infrastructure and Storage Setup

### Overview
This document outlines the foundational infrastructure implementation for the Fashion MNIST project on Google Cloud Platform. It establishes the secure, scalable compute and storage architecture necessary for machine learning workflows. The implementation includes a production-grade Vertex AI Workbench environment, properly secured service accounts with appropriate IAM permissions, and a strategically designed Cloud Storage architecture that separates development, datasets, and model artifacts for optimal organization and access control.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- Created Vertex AI Workbench instance:
  - Instance name: `fashion-mnist-gcp-instance`
  - Machine type: e2-standard-8 (8 vCPU, 32 GB memory)
  - Region: us-central1 (Iowa)
  - Zone: us-central1-a
  - JupyterLab version: 4.x (New)
  - Enabled idle shutdown after 180 minutes
  - Storage: 150 GB boot disk, 100 GB data disk (Balanced Persistent Disk)
  - Enabled Dataproc Serverless Interactive Sessions
  - Security features: Secure Boot, vTPM, Integrity monitoring
- Created service account:
  - Name: `workbench-gcp`
  - Email: workbench-gcp@fashion-mnist-gcp.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  - Assigned roles:
    - Vertex AI User
    - Notebooks Admin
    - Storage Object Admin
    - Storage Admin
    - Artifact Registry Reader
    - Artifact Registry Writer
    - Cloud Functions Developer
    - BigQuery Admin
    - BigQuery Data Owner

#### 2. Cloud Storage Architecture
- Established three-bucket architecture:
  - `fashion-mnist-dev`: Development artifacts and notebooks (type: development)
  - `fashion-mnist-datasets`: Raw and processed datasets (type: dataset)
  - `fashion-mnist-model`: Model artifacts and checkpoints (type: models)
- Configuration for all buckets:
  - Region: us-central1
  - Location type: Region
  - Storage class: Standard
  - Access control: Uniform
  - Public access prevention: Enabled
  - Encryption: Google-managed
  - Data protection: Soft delete enabled (7-day retention)
  - Labels: project=fashion-mnist-gcp, type={appropriate-type}

#### 3. Dataset Preparation
- Pending: Download Fashion MNIST dataset
- Pending: Upload raw data to `fashion-mnist-datasets` bucket
- Pending: Create organized folder structure within buckets

#### 4. Documentation
- Updated project structure with new bucket architecture
- Documented infrastructure decisions and rationale
- Created Phase 2 implementation guide

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Three-Bucket Architecture**: Separated development, datasets, and models for better organization and access control

2. **Instance Configuration**: Selected e2-standard-8 for balanced performance and cost, with comprehensive security settings

3. **Security Configuration**: 
   - Implemented uniform access control with public access prevention
   - Enabled secure boot, vTPM, and integrity monitoring
   - Created dedicated service account with least privilege access

4. **Storage Optimization**: Standard storage class for frequently accessed ML data with regional deployment

5. **Network Configuration**: Default VPC with external IP for development access, proxy access enabled
