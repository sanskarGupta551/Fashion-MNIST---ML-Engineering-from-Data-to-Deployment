# Fashion MNIST GCP [Phase 3]: (2/3) Custom Training Job with Experiments

### Overview
This document details the process of transitioning the Fashion MNIST image classification model from an interactive notebook environment to a containerized custom training job architecture for Vertex AI. This implementation demonstrates professional ML engineering practices by creating a modular, scalable training solution designed for Google Cloud's infrastructure. While quota limitations prevented the actual execution of the Vertex AI Custom Job, the complete architecture and implementation were successfully prepared, including Vertex AI Experiments integration for comprehensive tracking and analysis. An alternative local training approach was utilized to maintain project progress.

  WORKDIR /
  COPY trainer /trainer
  ENTRYPOINT ["python", "-m", "trainer.train"]
  ```
- Selected `tf2-cpu.2-3` base image for compatibility with our model requirements

### Challenge: Quota Limitations

When attempting to execute the Custom Training Job, we encountered quota limitations with the following error:

```
Training pipeline failed with error message: The following quota metrics exceed quota limits: aiplatform.googleapis.com/custom_model_training_cpus
```

Several attempts were made to resolve this issue:

1. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Reduced machine type from n1-standard-4 to n1-highmem-2
   - Attempted different regions (us-central1, us-west1)
   - Cleared existing workbench instances to free up resources

2. **Configuration Adjustments**:
   - Adjusted output paths and parameters
   - Selected preemptible instances where available
   - Reduced disk size and other resource requirements

Despite these efforts, the quota limitations persisted, which is a common challenge in cloud-based ML projects, especially with new GCP projects that have default quota settings.

### Solution: Alternative Training Approach

To ensure project progress, we implemented an alternative training approach:

1. **Local Training Execution**:
   - Executed the same training code on a local development environment
   - Maintained identical model architecture and hyperparameters
   - Preserved data processing and augmentation strategies
   - **Kept experiment tracking code** for consistency with cloud implementation

2. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Uploaded the locally trained model to the planned GCS location
   - Registered the model in Vertex AI Model Registry
   - Maintained consistency with the original implementation plan
   - **Manually logged experiment data** to preserve tracking capabilities

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated project documentation to reflect the adaptation
   - Added learnings about resource management and quota planning
   - **Included experiment tracking results** in analysis and evaluation

This approach demonstrates the flexibility and problem-solving skills essential for professional ML engineering, where adapting to infrastructure constraints is often necessary.

### Key Technical Achievements

#### 1. Model Portability

### Model Performance Results

The locally trained model achieved:
- Training accuracy: ~83%
- Validation accuracy: ~88% 
- Test accuracy: 45.57%
- Loss: 98.66
- Training time: 46 epochs (with early stopping)

All of these metrics were successfully logged to the Vertex AI Experiments platform, enabling detailed analysis and future comparison with other model architectures.

The significant disparity between validation and test accuracy (88% vs 45.57%) indicates a substantial generalization problem. Analysis of the confusion matrix shows certain class-specific issues, particularly with the model misclassifying many items as "Pullover".

4. **Model Generalization Challenges**:
