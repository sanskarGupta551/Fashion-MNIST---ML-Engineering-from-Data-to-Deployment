# Fashion MNIST [Phase 4]: (2/2) CI/CD Integration & Monitoring

## Overview
This document details the completion of Phase 4 implementation, focusing on establishing a robust CI/CD pipeline and monitoring infrastructure for the Fashion MNIST classification project on Google Cloud Platform. Building on the initial model deployment and serving infrastructure implemented in Phase 4 (1/2), this phase establishes automated deployment processes, continuous integration, and comprehensive monitoring - essential elements of professional ML engineering practices.

  - Error rate tracking
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
- Added ML-specific metrics:
  - Prediction request distribution
  - Model latency tracking
  - Endpoint availability monitoring
  - Class distribution visualization

- Configured appropriate check frequency and evaluation criteria
- Implemented proper notification channels for health alerts

#### Alert Policy Configuration
- Created critical operational alerts:
  - High Error Rate Alert (>5% error rate over 5-minute window)
  - Latency Degradation Alert (>1000ms for 95th percentile over 5 minutes)
  - Resource Utilization Alert (>80% CPU utilization for 10 minutes)
  - Prediction Service Error Alert (any errors in 5-minute window)
- Configured appropriate notification channels:
  - Email notifications for engineering team
  - Integration with project communication channels
- Implemented proper alert severity classification
- Established escalation policies for critical alerts
- Created documentation for alert response procedures

#### Logging Configuration
